These days I remove things.  Strip away distractions and polish my window onto the world.  Itâ€™s not about aesthetics or comfort, but about time.

At some point, a man must realize that preparation is over.  Yes, learning never ends, but he should not remain a student for too long.  Life is too short and there is work to be done.

Arm yourself with a handful of good books and mentors.  Master the basics.  Take only what you can carry easily and set sail.  Everything else is waste.
