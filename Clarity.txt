Title: Clarity
—-
These days I remove things. Strip away distractions and polish my window onto the world. It’s not about aesthetics or comfort, but about time.

At some point, preparation is over. Yes, learning never ends, but one should not remain a student for too long. Our lives are too short for these checklists that clutter our minds.

Arm yourself with a handful of good books and mentors. Master the basics. Take only what you can carry easily and set sail. Everything else is waste.
